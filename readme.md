## What is Cantos?

Cantos is a static website generator written in F#.  It is similar to [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll).

Use Cantos to:

* Generate a blog which you can host on [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/) or [Site44](http://www.site44.com/).
* Generate a website (with a blog) and some [books](https://github.com/bentayloruk/cantos/wiki/Books) with table of contents ([like this one](http://www.enticify.com/docs/commerce-server/developer/introduction/overview.html)).

## Pandoc Integrated

Cantos will use Pandoc if you have it installed (and MarkdownDeep if not).  Mainly because Pandoc is awesome.  [And this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13883627/is-it-possible-to-make-markdowndeep-or-markdownsharp-handle-mixed-html-markdown).

## Why the name Cantos?

Hmmm.  I may change the name (I quite like [morph](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morph_(character))).  I'm calling it Cantos at the moment as I'm on book 4 of Dan Simmons [Hyperion Cantos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperion_Cantos) and Cantos seemed more applicable than Shrike (I need a Shrike OSS project).  I'm listening to these books on Audible and they are AMAZING!
