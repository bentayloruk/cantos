## What is Cantos?

Cantos is a static website generator written in F#.  It is very similar to [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll).

You will be able to use Cantos to:

* Generate a blog which you can host on [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/) or [Site44](http://www.site44.com/).
* Generate a website with pages and *multiple* blogs.
* Generate Table of Contents for sub-sections of your site.

*None of this is far off operational.*

## Why not Jekyll or some other solution?

Two reasons:

- Default Jekyll does not have what I want for building [enticify.com](http://www.enticify.com) (e.g. TOC).  *Yes, I know it supports plugins*.
- Most of my F# code is private.  This is a public project for F# fun.

## F# related development objectives

* Aim for 100% type-first development.  [Why type-first development matters](http://tomasp.net/blog/type-first-development.aspx)
* Favour functional over OO.  *Objects are my default setting and I'm interested in fully exploring functional.*
* Actually just [watch Effective ML](http://vimeo.com/14313378).  I'm trying to do Effective F#!  *[Effective ML video points summary.](https://ocaml.janestreet.com/?q=node/75)*
* Use other F# OSS like [TickSpec](http://tickspec.codeplex.com/) and [Fake](https://github.com/fsharp/FAKE)

## Cantos needs you!

**Cantos needs F# gurus and grasshoppers alike**.  I feel fairly comfortable with the F# language, but want to work on my style (succinct but readable) and design.  Please join in and tell me what I'm doing wrong, or learn with me by trial and error.  I already kind of wrote this once as [Expandoc](https://github.com/bentayloruk/expandoc), but the code is a hack.  Cantos is supposed to be improved :).  

If this sounds like fun, get in touch.  I'd love to chat with you about design etc.  **As of 16/11/2012 Cantos is not fully-operational, but I'd be happy to bring you up to speed**.  Contact me on Twitter [@bentayloruk](https://twitter.com/bentayloruk) and then we can chat on Skype.

## Why the name Cantos?

Hmmm.  I may change the name.  I'm calling it Cantos at the moment as I'm on book 4 of Dan Simmons [Hyperion Cantos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperion_Cantos) and Cantos seemed more applicable than Shrike (I need a Shrike OSS project).  I'm listening to these books on Audible and they are AMAZING!
